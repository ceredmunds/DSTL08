  condition2Intro:"<br/>In the following you will see 6 types of entity or craft: <br/> <br/>" +
      "<b>Friendly</b> craft are those belonging to allies. <br/>" +
      "<b>Assumed friendly</b> craft are those we think belong to allies, but we are not sure.<br/>" +
      "<b>Hostile</b> craft are those belonging to enemies. <br/>" +
      "<b>Assumed hostile</b> craft are those we think belong to enemies, but we are not sure. <br/>" +
      "<b>Neutral</b> craft are those who are neither friendly nor enemies and are not relevant to any possible conflict (such as fishing boats or pleasure craft). <br/>" +
      "<b>Unknown</b> craft are those whose status is not yet known. They might turn out to be friendly, hostile or neutral. <br/><br/>",
