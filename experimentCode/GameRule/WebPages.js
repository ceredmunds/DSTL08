  ' Unfortunately, you failed to pass the status training.<br/> </h2>Thank you very much for your participation.<br/>This experiment aims to examine how best to represent uncertainty in decision-making tasks that are presented visually.   <br/>We are comparing three different ways of presenting this information (you only saw one of them!).  <br/> In the first way, there is no uncertainty '
  +
  'information.  <br/> In the second way, there is uncertainty information and it is represented as a different colour.  <br/> For instance, “friendly” and “assumed friendly” are represented by two '
  +
  ' different colours.  <br/> In the third way, there is uncertainty information and it is represented as the depth of shading.   <br/>For instance, “friendly” and “assumed friendly” are represented by                            the same colour, but one is filled, and one is only shaded.  <br/> We hope to see that including '

  'uncertainty information improves performance on the monitoring task.  <br/> <br/> Further, we hope              to identify which of the ways of presenting uncertainty is better.   <br/> '
